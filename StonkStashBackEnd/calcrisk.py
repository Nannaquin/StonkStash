Alright so Read this before reading my code.


This is actually more complicated than i thought it was.

so we have three changes going on.


for us to calculate risk 2.0

we need to calculate 2 things for now.


Volume 
Movement


These two movements have rate of changes as its good to know the rate of change for both variables


Volume = Share's bought or sold.
Movement = Stock price going up or down.


If a stocks movement within 7 days has drastically changed. Stock is high risk

if the shares bought or sold are drastically changing within 3 days. Many people buying or selling.
